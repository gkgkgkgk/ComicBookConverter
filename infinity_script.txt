Star-Lord: Everybody stay where you are. Chill F out. I’m gonna ask you this one time. Where’s Gamora?
Tony: Yeah, I’ll do you one better. Who’s Gamora?
Drax: I’ll do you one better! Why is Gamora?
Star-Lord: Tell me where the girl is, or I swear to you, I’m gonna French fry this little freak.
Tony: Let’s do it! You shoot my guy, I blast him. Let’s go!
Drax: Do it, Quill! I can take it.
